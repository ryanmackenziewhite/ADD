Record Linkage dataset generated
Based on Febrl generator

Febrl (Freely Extensible Biomedical Record Linkage) is a freely available tool that enables record linkage through a GUI.
The tool written in python which offers both a programming interface as well as GUI, supporting several record linakge
algorithms. In addition, the tool includes a data generator which generates two record data sets suitable for performing
record linkage. The data generator creates two datasets with the following random variables:
    field given a frequency table (histogram)
    date
    phone
    identification

The following probabilities are defined to modify
The second (duplicate) dataset draws randomly from first (original).
Each field defines a dictionary of probabilities:
Modify a given field
Mispell
Insert a character
Delete character
Substiture character
Swap two characters
Swap two fields
Swap words in field
Split a word
Merge words
Null field
Insert new value

Random selection for number of duplicates for each record, following distributions:
    Uniform
    Poisson
    Zipf
    
    For each duplicate apply the modifications up to:
    Maximum number of modifications for a given record -- fixed
    Maximum number of modifications for a given field -- randomly select number of modiication

Straightforward to implement.
Requires suitable dictionaries for generating proper Canadian addresses.
Requires dictionary of commonly mispelled words (with list of misspellings).
This will also serve well for the Postal data.
